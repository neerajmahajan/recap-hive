* Hive is a datawarehouse application.
* Used to run batch queries on structured data.
* Can handle large data sets reliably.
* Allows to run MapReduce jobs without learnig java code.
* Hive is good for structured data like tables. Unstructured data such as Json may require some manipulation before it is usable in Hive.
* Hive is commonly used for batch queries and we can write batch scripts.
* Once Hive query is completed, the results will be either submitted to the command line or UI or user can store into another table or as .csv file for later use. These exported results can be loaded back into HDFS.
